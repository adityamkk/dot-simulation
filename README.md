# Dot Simulation

Simple simulation using the JS Graphics Engine, made to learn the JS Graphics library's features and prepare for future projects

## Description

Dots of various sizes and colors move around the screen. Some dots are of slightly different sizes than others (initially), but all are of the same blue/green color palette.
When 2 dots collide, the larger one begins to absorb the other one. Dots that absorb become bigger and redder, while dots that are being absorbed become smaller and bluer.
Dots will bounce off the walls upon collision

A "player" dot will appear in the top left corner of the screen.
This dot will follow the cursor and can be guided to certain destinations.
If the player dot is absorbed, there will be no response to the cursor from any other dot
